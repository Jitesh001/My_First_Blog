If this is you, I want to acknowledge all you’re doing.\r\n\r\nBut for those of you who, like me, shelter in place alone (or with another), but without your usual work to occupy your day, how are you using your time?  \r\n\r\nThe following piece from Leo Baubata at Zen Habits, which I find to be such a cogent reminder, underlines choice points we can make about our time from a spiritual perspective.  \r\n\r\nIf that’s not your leaning, you can consider these same choices in relation to going deeper with your art,  your healing, your self-discovery, or your learning.', 'solitude.jpg', '2020-05-22'),

After all, you don’t want to die with regrets or leave a mess behind for your family or friends to clean up.\r\n\r\nPreparing for death can also help you appreciate the preciousness of this life.  It can inspire you to get your priorities straight, and live your remaining time – hopefully many years – with intention.\r\n\r\nSo let’s look at some of the important steps you can take to prepare for death.', 'death.jpg', '2020-05-22'),
(16, 'How to Be More Generous', 'Let\'s be some generous', 'blog-be generous', 'Did you know, generosity is good for you?\r\n\r\nAccording to psychology, generous people say they’re happier, healthier, and more content with life than those who don’t give.  And generosity benefits your mental health in even more ways because it can bring about a sense of pleasure, connection to others, and deeper feelings of trust.\r\n\r\nFrom a spiritual perspective, the practice of generosity, when expressed through a loving, selfless intent, decreases attachment.  That’s beneficial to you because attachment to possessions, people, circumstances, and yourself can cause so much suffering when things change, as they inevitably do. \r\n\r\nRead More: How to Let Go of Self-Attachment (And Why It Matters)\r\n\r\nLearning to let go is essential to your spiritual growth too.  And practicing generosity now may help you feel more at peace when death arrives and asks you to let go of every single thing.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, generosity turns out to be as beneficial to the giver as it is to the receiver.  \r\n\r\nBut that’s only the case when you give selflessly to help others and without expectations for your own gain. If you expect praise, fame, gifts or favors in return, you’ll only feel resentful and disappointed if it’s not forthcoming.  Once those kinds of feelings arisings, the joy of giving freely vanishes.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to choose gifts wisely too, and to never give anything harmful. Giving a bottle of booze to an alcoholic, for example, would not be generosity.\r\n\r\nWhen Generosity Is Hard:  Start Small\r\nI know it can be hard to give.  Sometimes I feel scared to give myself.\r\n\r\nMaybe you fear having nothing left or wonder if you’ll need a particular thing later on. Perhaps the thought of giving away something so simple as your favorite mug makes your heart skip a beat. And of course, you absolutely don’t want to share half your candy bar, you might starve!  \r\n\r\nThese kinds of fears and hesitations can be deeply rooted in your unconscious mind.  So don’t judge yourself if you start to contract at the thought of giving.  Despite all the raves you read here about the power of generosity, giving won’t increase your sense of well-being if it strikes fear into your heart.', 'generous.jpg', '2020-05-22'),
(17, 'A Beautiful Way to Find Peace of Mind', 'Wanna peace in your life?', 'blog-peace', 'Do you wonder how to find inner peace?  Do you every ask yourself what it means to have peace of mind or if it’s even possible?\r\n\r\nYou might think I have it all figured out because I write this personal/spiritual development blog.  You might imagine that I live in a state of constant inner peace and always act from a loving heart.\r\n\r\nBut I’m still very much on the journey, and sometimes, those perfect, idealized ways of being seem far, far away.  \r\n\r\nIndeed, over the past few years, bit my bit, my world turned upside down. Everything I relied upon was stripped away.  \r\n\r\nInstead of inner peace, I’ve felt heart-broken, bereaved, and completely disillusioned.  I’ve felt lonely, lost, and uncertain.  I’ve found myself falling into self-blame and self-criticism, so subtle at times it would go on and on before I caught myself.  I’ve found myself wanting it all to be different, but also knowing it can never be the same nor would I truly want it to be.\r\n\r\nGetting Real on the Spiritual Path\r\nI’ve come to see I had unrealistic, sometimes far-fetched, ideas about my spiritual path, fueled by a narcissistic teacher, and about my own capacities as a spiritual seeker.  Maybe I needed everything to be stripped away, like a hard knock on the head that brought me to my senses and face-to-face with a more matter-of-fact version of myself and what it truly means to be a truth seeker.\r\n\r\nIn light of all that’s happened, I’ve had to let go of magical thinking and see the spiritual path as it truly is.  There may be a handful of exceptional people who suddenly wake up and live in peace, love, and clarity.  But for most of us, spiritual awakening doesn’t occur in an instant, in six-months, or even a single lifetime.  Finding inner peace takes commitment, and practice.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it’s not easy to let go of negative emotions or to simply remain in or return to the present moment, practices that bring about a sense of peace and form the essence of many spiritual paths.  We’ve been conditioned, all our lives, to follow and exaggerate distressing thoughts, and  to live in the past or the future.  No wonder my mind tormented me, when everything I had relied upon feel away.  \r\n\r\nI had perspective from my years of spiritual training, thank goodness.  But still, there were times when my mind and heart felt tormented for hours and even days.\r\n\r\nI’m reminded of something the 19th century mystic, Terton Sogyal has said about liberating negative thoughts, which puts the ability to find inner peace - what it really takes -  into perspective:\r\n\r\n“The real, true sign of whether you can liberate or not is when you actually meet, face to face, negative circumstances and thoughts, which arise blazing like a raging fire or bubbling like boiling water. If at that very moment you are able to liberate them, then that is really the same as a true miracle.”\r\n\r\nIf you are able to liberate one attachment, one aversion, one negative thought, then many aeons of negative karma are purified.” \r\n\r\nIsn’t it just wishingful thinking, the spiritual equivalent to the happy ending, to believe you’ll quickly reach a state of equanimity, in which difficult circumstances and negative thoughts no longer faze you?  \r\n\r\nWouldn’t it be more realistic to accept that, surely as a beginner and even as a dedicated meditator, negative thoughts and emotions will continue to arise in your mind, perhaps for a long time?  Sure, you’ll have more moments of peace, maybe even stretches of peacefulness. But it will take time to more thoroughly erase the negative tendencies of mind.  Just like when you try to erase writing on a piece of paper; often, there’s a stubborn residue that remains.', 'peace.jpg', '2020-05-22'),
(18, '10 Things I’ve Learned About Gratitude', 'Gratitude is the fairest blossom which springs from the soul.', 'blog-gratitude', 'Today, I want to share 10 Things I Have Learned about Gratitude:\r\n1.) It is important to express gratitude, even if it is hard. Sometimes life is so challenging that even the thought of being grateful puts us in a tailspin. When we focus on our losses and failures, feeling melancholy or alone, we are blinded to finding even little things for which to be grateful.\r\n\r\n2.) Keeping a gratitude journal will increase your happiness. It’s laudable to verbally give thanks, but writing it down is doubly powerful.  Keep a gratitude journal so that it becomes a practice to spend a few moments daily, or at least weekly, jotting down what you are grateful for–even small things like the smell of newly cut grass, or your cozy bed.\r\nAccording to Dr. Christiane Northrup, as little as 15-20 seconds of practicing gratitude can lower stress hormones, increase the flow of oxygen to every cell of your body and harmonize your heart’s rhythms with your body’s other systems.\r\n3.) The more specific we are in the details when writing our gratitude, the more powerful the results will be.  For example, the stranger at the airport who saw you running with two carry-ons and simply offered to take them for you all the way across the concourse where you made the last call for your flight (and don’t forget the pilot, the flight attendants, and the security people who all contributed to getting you to your destination safely.)\r\n\r\n4.) There is scientific proof that gratitude works wonders in our lives. If common sense doesn’t convince us to be grateful, then science might. Dr. Emmons from the University of California at Davis is working on a long-term research project to determine and highlight how gratitude heals, energizes, and creates happiness.  Two of Dr. Emmons’ findings are:\r\nGratitude is related to a 10 percent improvement in sleep quality in patients with chronic pain, 76 percent of whom had insomnia, and 19 percent lower depression levels.\r\nTwo gratitude activities (counting blessings and gratitude letter writing) reduced the risk of depression in at-risk patients by 41 percent over a six month period.\r\n5.) Being grateful keeps you in the present moment. It is hard to feel unhappy while you are being grateful. We don’t ruminate about the future or regret the past. We are engaged in thoughts of good and focusing on blessings. This is not denying that we may have challenges and painful events in our lives; it is simply shifting our perception to giving thanks often.\r\n6.) When giving thanks and being grateful become a habit in our lives, then gratitude inspires action.  For example, The November 12th show on CBS Sunday Morning featured the restaurant owners of Rooster Soup Company of Philadelphia.\r\nChef Mike was so grateful that his business partner, Steve, had stepped in and had done an intervention to help him kick his cocaine and heroin addictions, that the decision was made to donate 100% of their profits to the Broad Street Ministry to feed the homeless.  The first week of donations fed around 100 people.\r\n\r\n7.) Gratitude is not solely directed outward.  It is important to focus gratitude inward and appreciate yourself.  In your journal, take note of everything you are and all that you do.  Acknowledge yourself, for example, for learning not to beat yourself up after making a mistake.  Check in on the progress you’ve made.  How far have you come since last Thanksgiving, or since last summer?\r\n\r\n8.) Make a list of the people who have supported you in your life. Again, be specific; mention the ways in which those individuals have contributed to your progress and well-being. Be sure to include the neighbor who went out of her way to deliver a misdirected package, the customer service representative who circumvented several extra steps to resolve your cell phone issue, the farmers who provide you with delicious produce.\r\n\r\n9.) Take the extra time to complete that survey at the end of a call when you have received excellent service, and, if you have noted it, mention the representative by name.  Go out of your way to speak to a supervisor or a manager about an employee who has gone the extra mile to help you.\r\n\r\n10.) Acknowledge everything you receive, notice simple pleasures, be thankful. Begin seeing that everything in your life is a miracle, worthy of your ultimate gratitude.\r\n“If all of this [happiness, better sleep, less stress] happens when you focus for just 15-20 seconds on something that brings you pleasure, joy, or a feeling of gratitude, imagine what would happen to your health-and our world-if you were able to cultivate and express gratitude and appreciation on a regular basis. That’s pretty powerful stuff.”\r\n', 'gratitude.jpg', '2020-05-22'),
(19, 'Connection Between Happiness and Travel', 'Doing what you like is freedom, liking what you do is happiness.', 'blog-travel', 'I suggest that travel can be one of those experiences. We can feel a sense of freedom not having to answer to anyone for a while. Our own thoughts come back to us in a refreshing way. Happiness stems in part from the transformative effect of meeting new people in other cultures, where we see that life can be lived in so many different fashions. Conversations with strangers can spark creativity and joy. Author Lawrence Block wrote, “Our happiest moments as tourists always seem to come when we stumble upon one thing while in pursuit of something else.”\r\nThe experience of travel can bring us joy because we are transported away from our normal routine and habits. It gives us an escape from newspapers and time schedules.  When visiting a place, connecting with a local can make it more authentic.  I love that in any moment a surprise awaits around the corner–musicians entertaining in the streets, a food truck, a beautiful panorama that soothes our soul.\r\nTravel is an experience worthy of investment.  Yet we can gather experiences to create happiness without straining our bank accounts. We can go camping, visit nearby towns with art walks, museums, and local cultural treasures, and picnic and hike in city parks. Beautiful and unusual mind stretching experiences, such as meeting an angel outside of a church in Italy happen spontaneously when you travel; these can bring you happiness.\r\n\r\n Even if you journey to your neighboring town 20 miles away, adventure there with a curious mind, an open heart, and the willingness to meet new people who love the culture of their own cities', 'travel.jpg', '2020-05-22'),
(20, 'Thoughtful Thursday: Mindless to Mindful', 'Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet.', 'blog-mindful', 'Mindful-based schools, mindful medicine, mindful childbirth and parenting, mindful coaching, mindful public relations.  It seems that the words mindful and mindfulness are on everyone’s lips these days, although as a practice, mindfulness has been around for at least 2000 years.\r\n\r\nMany people associate mindfulness with some form of Buddhist meditation, the practice of being continuously present with one’s experience, a concept which is not incompatible with most of the world’s major religions.\r\n\r\nWhat does mindfulness mean exactly?  Jon Kabat-Zinn, founder of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, a meditation-based therapy and the director of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine defines it this way, “paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.”\r\n\r\nSince the 1970’s Kabat-Zinn has conducted extensive research on the effects of mindfulness on peoples’ behavior, physiology, and psychology.  The results show positive benefits in many areas of life: stress reduction and decreased anxiety, increased clarity and mental focus, decreased depression and less emotional reactivity, increased relationship satisfaction, increased immunity and overall better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHowever, Kabat-Zinn is quick to point out that a meditation technique is not necessary to become more mindful.  “It’s about living your life as if it mattered, moment by moment by moment by moment.”\r\n\r\nAnother expert in the field, Harvard researcher Ellen Langer would wholeheartedly agree.  In fact, she has been studying the secular form of mindfulness for more than four decades.  Dubbed by many the “mother of mindfulness,” Langer is the author of 11 books, 5 on mindfulness; she defines mindfulness as “the simple act of actively noticing things-with a result of increased health, competence, and happiness.” When we are not actively noticing things, we are on autopilot or acting unconsciously. We are mindless.\r\n\r\nIn 1979, Langer conducted a landmark study, the “counterclockwise” experiments, that forever influenced the fields of positive psychology, mind-body medicine, aging–even economics to name just a few.  A group of men in their eighties was dropped off at a monastery for a week in the rolling hills of New Hampshire-into 1959. The men were asked to live as if it were 1959; they were surrounded by décor and paraphernalia of that era, and were told not to discuss anything occurring after that time.  The news and sports they watched on the television was from 20 years earlier.  They spoke of their loved ones and lived in every way as if it were 1959.\r\n\r\nThe results were astonishing.  The men showed changes in physiology, affect, and mental alertness.  They had lower blood pressure, more dexterity, improved hearing, eyesight and memory, more independence, decrease in diabetes and arthritic changes.  They became younger, mentally and physically. Some who arrived with canes walked out carrying their suitcases.\r\n\r\nLanger summarizes, “We often let our mindset about aging rule.  If you forget something, for example, you say, ‘Ah. That’s because I’m old.’  You don’t engage in lots of activities, because after all you’re too old for them.”\r\n\r\nAs a young doctor, Deepak Chopra was deeply impacted by Langer’s ‘counterclockwise’ experiments and subsequently incorporated the principles from her findings in his mind-body medicine and anti-aging practice.  “In every moment we have the opportunity to awaken…to let go of whatever fear, constriction, and stories are running through our mind as we come fully into the present moment.  And it is only in the present moment that we can experience happiness.”\r\n\r\nHow do we move from Mindless to Mindful?\r\n\r\nHere’s what the experts say:\r\n1.)   “Pay close attention to your breathing, especially when you’re feeling intense emotions,” says Kabat-Zinn.  When you notice the in and out of your breath, the rise and fall of your belly, it brings you into the present moment.\r\n2.)   “Notice-really notice-what you’re sensing in any given moment, the sights, sounds, and smells that ordinarily slip by without reaching your conscious awareness,” continues Kabat-Zinn.  Using the discrimination of the mind to notice dramatically reduces the flurry of thoughts which usually accompanies mindless activity.\r\n\r\n3.) “Actively notice new things, relinquish previous mindsets, and act on new observations.”  According to Ellen Langer this opens you up to new possibilities, new connections, new perspectives and new behavior.  Without this we engage in mindless activity, based on old thinking, conclusions and habits.  “Most ills people experience are a result of mindlessness.”\r\n\r\n4.) “Be fully present while you are eating,” says Langer.  Avoid eating in the car, on the go, or while reading or watching TV. As you take the first bite, notice and appreciate the taste and texture, sight and smell of the food, as if you’ve never tasted it before.  This improves the quality of digestion, especially if you chew slowly and for longer, thereby increasing the enzyme activity in your mouth and lightening the load on the rest of the digestive system.\r\n\r\nIf you want to check out some tools for changing your beliefs so you can be more mindful and look at things from a fresh perspective like the men in Ellen Langer’s experiment, check out my coaching page.\r\n\r\nYou can live the sweet life wherever you are, whoever you’re with, whatever you’re doing. If you can let go of previous conclusions, viewpoints, beliefs, or judgments and be in the present moment this is moving from mindless to mindful.', 'mindful.jpg', '2020-05-22'),
(21, 'To Do Lists & Open Books', 'I like a list, I am controlling. ', 'blog-list', 'I love to open a book — a good one, still not used to reading my iPad — the sharp edges pressing into my hands, not being able to read in the sunshine. But open a book, and I think I smell the ink, and the worn wood crushed to make the paper offered up to me and other readers.\r\n\r\nGod help me but I still love Italian memoirs. I just re-read Ferenc Mate’s The Hills of Tuscany and the follow up, A Vineyard in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nHe is a fabulous writer, with a knack for story telling, details, sense of humor, and skill in execution of adventure. He and his wife are actually avid sailors adventuring often in Tahiti and in the northwestern waters of the US, so I imagine them courageous and a little crazy. I convinced my husband to read the Vineyard, and in the first pages he was chuckling out loud. Yes! Because we are going to be driving around that area of Tuscany in September, maybe we’ll visit Ferenc’s vineyard, which I’ve wanted to do since I first read his book six years ago. So much to do in Italy and even on vacation, there is also a To Do List.\r\n\r\nWhat would life be like without  To Do Lists?\r\nI actually need a list or I just spin out into mediocrity. Let’s back track on that—I choose not to follow a To Do List all the time, but it’s important that I have one, so I don’t have to keep the chores inside my head, or forget an important task. I add HAVE FUN on my To Do List too including meet a friend for lunch, do yoga, go to the local coffee house.\r\n\r\nI can toss the list aside to read an open book that is calling me!\r\nI have new arm chairs placed in the two bedrooms on the main floor of my house (a friend gave them to me), and they call me into their flowery arms, “bring your book and cup of English Breakfast tea, put your feet up, and read to your heart’s content.”  And I run to them like a young lover, and languish more than I used to. I may even take with me my notebook of TO DO’s. I am learning  over and over everyday not to feel like a failure if I don’t complete the eternal TO DO List.\r\n\r\nI just decided this morning during an Option Method session, that when I think of that list, I’m going to acknowledge what I DID get done. It is a myth that the to do list will ever be completed. Oh it will be for a day or two, maybe, but it grows like the weeds in my garden on these rainy summer days.\r\n\r\nHere is how to handle a TO DO LIST:\r\n1. Write on the front of a spiral note BOOK, which is an open book, I LOVE MY WONDERFUL TO DO LIST! add some pictures to the front of it.\r\n\r\n2. Divide the paper in half: ON the left column: TO CALL, On the right column: TO DO\r\n\r\n3. Create a page with the word ‘Successes’ on the top, and just jot down what you’ve accomplished whenever you feel like it or when you start beating yourself up for not completing everything on the list. This is just so you realize you’re doing stuff.\r\n\r\n4. Make a cup of tea,coffee, lemonade, martini or whatever, and play every day like a child would, with freedom and abandonment—go catch a bluegill or play jacks with Mary Ellen (if she can get away from her to do list),\r\n\r\n5. Be sure to add play time, exercise time, hanging out time on the to do list, and that is to be added to your successes! I harvested basil and garlic yesterday instead of writing a blog post or finishing the work on moving my website over to a wordpress site. Then I made pesto with toasted pistachios, basil, olive oil, garlic, and then made marinara sauce.\r\n\r\nI added it to my successes after I beat myself up for procrastinating the other more important work of writing and moving the website. The open book is calling me, and I want that on my master to do list too!', 'list.jpg', '2020-05-22');
